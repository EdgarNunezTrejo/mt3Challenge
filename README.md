# This application was developed by Edgar Nu√±ez Trejo.

I choose ReactJS because I think it is a way better and faster way to develop frontend applications
and also the size of the comunity that is continiously updating, upgrading and setting new ways of
work since is opensource.

Also I selected it over Angular as is not a framework enterily but a library and it is not as
heavy as Angular, flutter or vue. Besides, the way of programming and coding is the same for
React Native/Expo so the learning curve is not quite heavy.

I made the most of the requirements, it shows a list that is previously designed inside the frontend
as it doesnt make any API/Rest request and it starts with 4 pendings.

It set the ones that must be solved today(current date) or the next date (tomorrow) are shown in color #FFD6D6,
other way they are gonna be white #FFFFFF, they are sorted by date, you can add new pendings as ACTIVE status,
change the status to DONE and they wont be showed on screen but a counter must be increased as the same as you create one new.

You can delete them and add a new with the same name, but if the text is the same as one that is already shown then
an alert must tell you that you cant add one with that text.

It allows you to drag and drop the cards where you want them to be placed.
